A customizable control panel that allows the user to create a set of buttons and customize them to run commands whose output is placed into the output area below the buttons.

The user can also save the "session", which amounts to the current button configuration, window size, and window position, into the chosen session file and load them later.

To load a session from the command-line on startup:
java --jar CustomControlPanel.jar session-filename

If a session is loaded, it will autosave to the current session-file
on close
