A customizable control panel that allows the user to create a set of buttons and customize them to run commands whose output is placed into the output area below the buttons.

The user can also save the "session", which amounts to the current button configuration, window size, and window position, into the chosen session file and load it back the next time the program is
used.

To load a session from the command-line on startup:
java --jar CustomControlPanel.jar session-filename
